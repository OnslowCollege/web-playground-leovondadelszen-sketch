    Rohit Sharma is an Indian international cricketer and the current captain of the Indian national team in limited-overs formats. Born on April 30, 1987, in Nagpur, Maharashtra, Sharma is widely regarded as one of the best opening batsmen in modern cricket. He made his international debut in 2007 and has since established himself as a key player for India across all formats of the game. Known for his elegant stroke play and ability to score big centuries, Sharma holds several records, including being the only player to score three double centuries in One Day Internationals (ODIs). As of 2025, he continues to be a vital asset for Indian cricket, leading the team with distinction and contributing significantly with the bat.
